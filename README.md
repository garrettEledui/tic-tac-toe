# TIC-TAC-TOE


In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

This app uses MUI. I apologize for the heavy weight library. It will be a beefing npm install but it was a library with which I was already pretty familar

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


Start the app by running:

### `npm start`


Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
